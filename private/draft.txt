Hello professor KC,
I am Sheel Shah, from the editorial team of BackgroundHum - our department's newsletter.
For the next release of the newsletter, we plan on writing an article revolving around you and your work as HoD. The plan is to interview you and then formulate the answers into an article.
Hence, we would love to talk to you whenever you have the time and conduct the interview. The interview is expected to go for approximately _ hours. So please suggest a time to talk, preferably over the coming week.
Thanks and regards on behalf of the BackgroundHum team, Sheel.
